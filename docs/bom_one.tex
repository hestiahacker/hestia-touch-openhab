This is the bill of materials to make your own HestiaPi.  The AC/DC converter
allows your HestiPi to be powered by the HVAC unit, but it requires that your
HVAC system has a common wire.  If your system does not have a common wire
(e.g., if it only has Red, Green, White, and Yellow wires), the AC/DC converter
will not work.  In that case, you will need a 5V/1A DC power supply, and your
hestia will need to be plugged into a wall outlet.

The LCD headers need to be 15mm long, with 12mm of that being on the top of the
board.  Standard headers are not long enough to allow the LCD to clear the
relays.
