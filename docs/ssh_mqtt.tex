\subsubsection{MQTT Configuration}
All the topics are defined in the .things
\href{https://github.com/HestiaPi/hestia-touch-openhab/wiki/File-Structure-&-Paths-ONE}{file}.

Confirm by subscribing from another laptop to all (\#) MQTT IDs and listen for
published messages while you play with your HestiaPi. For Linux users, run this
in a terminal:

\texttt{mosquitto\_sub -h [HESTIA\_PI\_IP] -d -t hestia/\#}
